# Naptua
Like Napture, but in Lua!

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress. Many features are not done and it's not yet "usable".

> [!WARNING]
> TERRIBLE CODE WARNING

A browser made for Windows with exclusive developer tools such as built-in documentation, Naptua RawInspect, and Naptua Deproin!

| PROS ðŸ™‚ | CONS ðŸ’€ |
| ---- | ---- |
| Has many tools for developers | Mostly unfinished |
| Less broken on Windows than Napture | Uses Windows native GUI without styling |
| Written in a language that makes it easy to work with | Code is not so good, though |

As said, it is not finished, so don't expect it to work properly. It's a two day project and a messy code. Later I'll take my time to clean it.
