> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress. Many features are not done and it's not yet "usable".

> [!WARNING]
> TERRIBLE CODE WARNING

A WebX browser made for Windows with exclusive developer tools such as built-in documentation, Naptua RawInspect, and Naptua Deproin!

### PROS and CONS of NAPTUA

| PROS ðŸ™‚ | CONS ðŸ’€ |
| ---- | ---- |
| Has many tools for developers | Mostly unfinished |
| Less broken on Windows than Napture | Uses Windows native GUI without styling |
| Written in a language that makes it easy to work with | Code is not so good, though |
| Custom rendering engine | (Not really a custom rendering engine) |
| ... | Broken (mostly) |
| ... | (for now) requires self compiling (downloading the framework) |

As said, **it is not finished**, so don't expect it to work properly and don't get surpirsed by it having more cons than pros. It's a two day project and a messy code. Later I'll take my time to clean it.

### HOW TO RUN

- Download the [LuaRT](https://luart.org/doc/install.html) framework
- Clone this repo and `cd` into it.
- Run `wluart main.wlua`.
- Naptua will open. **Warning for developers: defaults to light mode**.

### KNOWN BUGS

(writing this kind of things is when you realise how good / bad of a developer you are)

- When rendering with Nafart, any interaction with the search bar crashes the program. When it is the WebX documentation, the topbar / action menu makes it crash aswell.
- CSS not loaded by Nafart.
- DNS cache limited to 5 entries (if more, sometimes JSON gets cropped for unknown reasons).
- Entering a `buss://` URL in the search bar crashes the program.
- ~~Some websites do not open, return a Lua error and crash the program. For example, [`buss://chat.dev`](https://github.com/TheAspectDev/webx-chat.lol) or [`fuckcommonjs.fr`](https://github.com/efekos/webx-fuckcommonjs).~~ **Fixed!**
- Clicking GO on an already loaded website (as [`chat.it`](https://github.com/PixelFacts/chatroom) somehow does work) crashes the program.

### CONTRIBUTING

Alright, I know this codebase sucks, but I do believe I can get this to work. Obviusly, I won't _actively_ develop it, but won't let it abandoned either and will actually check PRs as soon as I receive them. So if you do also have faith that this "thing" can get somewhere, feel free to make any contribution! Thanks.

Made by Zaka with pure hate towards HTTP* and pure reconsidering too many things about life :]

> * spent more time getting that f^cking thing to work and fetch WebX sites than writing all the rest of the program - and still doesnt work
